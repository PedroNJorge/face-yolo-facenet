Why a Pipeline?
Your project naturally has sequential stages:

Input (image/video frame) →

Face Detection (YOLO finds faces) →

Face Extraction (crop faces) →

Encoding (convert face to embedding vector) →

Matching (compare with Redis database) →

Output (recognition results)

A pipeline orchestrates this flow cleanly.
